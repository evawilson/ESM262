## Assignment Instructions 

Design a function - you can pick any subject and you can even make up the equations as long as they conceptually make sense
  X Make sure it has at least 2 inputs and 1 parameter (ideally more) and at least 2 outputs
  X Code your function in R, save as a R file in subdirectory called R
  X Make sure you include documentation (both at the top as we’ve shown in past examples, and inline)
  X Include some error checking

In an Rmarkdown file, generate some data for 2 of the function inputs
  Use a for loop to run the function for the data
  Repeat the “looping” using something from the “purrr” package
  Graph results (you can decide what the most interesting way to graph - you just need to make one graph)

X Write at least 2 tests for your function; store in a separate test file

Put this in a git repo that includes an R subdirectory a tests subsdirectory and an Rmarkdown file and submit the link on Gauchospace (or you can put all of this in a new git repo or a subdirectory of an existing git repo)

## Step 1. Source function 
```{r}
source(here("R/irrigation.R"))
```

## Step 2. List assumptions 

1. **Precipitation:** We assume that precipitation is normally distributed. The mean precipitation is 2.5 mm/day with a standard deviation of 1 mm/day. 

2. **ET:** We assume that average ET for wheat is 2.04 mm/day, corn is 2.54 mm/day, and barley is 3.00 mm/day. 

3. **Possible Crops:** There are 50 fields in our analysis that are subject to the same rainfall. We assume each occurs equally (we use random sample).

## Step 3. Create data frames to test functionality
```{r}
# create vector of crop type
possible.crop = c("wheat","corn","barley")
# use sample to simulate a random recording of fields for analysis
possible.crop = base::sample(possible.crop, size=50, replace=T)
# possible.crop as a factor for better plotting
possible.crop = as.factor(possible.crop)
# to quickly get frequencies of different crops and to plot 
summary(possible.crop)
plot(possible.crop, col="blue")

# specify base ET (mm/day) (see assumptions)
ET_wheat = 2.04
ET_wheat = 2.54
ET_barley = 3.00

# generate a normal distribution of random precipitation data
# note that 10 mm converts to 0.394 inches.  
precipitation <- rnorm(100, mean = 2.5, sd = 1)
# view the first 10 values of the precipitation data
head(precipitation, 10)
# quickly visualize to see distribution
plot(density(precipitation))

# combine generated data into a single frame 

#1.CROP_TYPE
#2. ET VALUE (CONSISTENTLY 2.04)
#3. OUR RANGE OF PRECIP (LOG DISTRIBUTION)

```

# Step 4. Use the *pmap* loop to run the function for the data 
```{r}
# run pmap to generate two outputs:
# soil moisture availability output and amount output

knitr::include_graphics(here("brainstorm_irrigation.png"))
```

# Step 5. Graph results (KATHERYN)
```{r}
# we can plot the soil moisture availability and facet_wrap by crop_type 
# ggplot(data = , aes(x=, y=)+
       # geom_histogram(stat="count")+
         #labs()
```

# Step 6. Run two tests to make sure this function is working (KATHERYN)
```{r}
# source data
here("irrigation.R")
# put your test in a file
# LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ACCESSING THIS? I JUST CREATED TWO BASIC FUNCTION TESTS USING EXPECT_EQUAL
#test_file(here("irrigation_works.R"))
```
