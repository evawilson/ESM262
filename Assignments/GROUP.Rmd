## Project Description

We designed the following Fire Risk Assessment program (see *Figure 1*).

*Step 1.* Determine necessary input data for your program. Input data is the "what" that is manipulated. To generate our fire risk assessment, we identified the following data for input: precipitation, weather, topography, and a fuel index. These inputs are represented by orange squares in Figure 1 below.

*Step 2.* Establish our desired final output. We would like to have a raster file depicting fire probability (as an aggregate score) by each 10 by 10m pixel. Our final output is represented by a purple hexagon in Figure 1 below. 

*Step 3.* Set your parameters. Parameters determine "how" the manipulation is done. Our parameters are represented by blue circles in Figure 1 below. We included the following parameters for each input (see below). Exact threshold values can be specified by unique users.

a. Input: Precipitation 
Parameter (threshold calculator): Input data must be a daily average during fire season less than or equal to XX cm/day (to be defined by user)

b. Input: Snow pack and soil moisture 
Parameters (threshold calculators): Snow pack input data is less than or equal to XZ in cm + soil moisture input data is less than or equal to XX cm^3/cm^3 (to be defined by user)

c. Input: Weather 
Parameter (threshold calculator): Temperature must be greater than or equal to XX degrees C + wind speed must be greater than or equal to XX knots (to be defined by user)  

d. Input: Topography 
Parameters (threshold calculator): Slope data must have a slope angle greater than or equal to XX dy/dx + aspect input data must have an aspect greater than or equal to XX degrees clockwise (to be defined by user)

e. Input: Fuel Index 
Parameters (threshold calculator): NDVI input must be less than or equal to XX # between -1-1 + fuel size class input must be greater than or equal to XX hours (to be defined by user)

f. Each of these parameters creates an interim output (represented by green parallelograms). Added together using a final "parameter calculation", these interim outputs generate a single raster output:
a + b + c + d + e = f (where f = final output)
