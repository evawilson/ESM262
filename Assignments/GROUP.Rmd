## Project Description

We designed the following Fire Risk Assessment program (see *Figure 1*).

*Step 1.* Determine necessary input data for your program. Input data is the "what" that is manipulated. To generate a fire risk assessment, we identified the following data for input: precipitation, weather, topography, and a fuel index. These inputs are represented by orange squares in Figure 1 below.

*Step 2.* Establish our desired final output. We would like to have a raster file depicting fire probability by each 10m by 10m pixel. Our final output is represented by a purple square in Figure 1 below. 

*Step 3.* Set your parameters. Parameters determine "how" the manipulation is done. Our parameters are represented by blue circles in Figure 1 below. We included the following parameters for each input:

a. Input: Precipitation 
Parameters: Daily average (precipitation input data must present a daily average during fire season greater than or equal to XX cm/day)

b. Input: Snow pack and soil moisture 
Parameters: Snow pack threshold value (snow pack input data is less than or equal to X in cm) + soil moisture threshold value (soil moisture input data is less than or equal to X cm^3/cm^3)

c. Input: Weather 
Parameters: Temperature (weather input data must be greater than or equal to X degrees C) + wind speed (weather input must be greater than or equal to X knots)  

d. Input: Topography 
Parameters: Slope (topography input data must have a slope angle greater than or equal to dy/dx) + aspect (topography input data must have an aspect greater than or equal to X degrees clockwise)

e. Input: Fuel Index 
Parameters: NDVI (NDVI input must be greater than or equal to -1) + fuel size class (fuel index input must be greater than or equal to X hours)

f. Added together, these parameters generate a single raster output:
a + b + c + d + e = f (where f = final output)
